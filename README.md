Documenting My Air-fryer Experiments

The air-fryer I'm currently using can be found here: [Heissluftfriteuse on Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/Heissluftfriteuse-Programmen-Friteuse-Heissluft-Heißluftfritteuse/dp/B0BZPQ4BNH/ref=sr_1_21?__mk_de_DE=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&crid=1M8EH2XJ985VY&keywords=heißluftfritteuse+2+kammern+groß&qid=1701709365&s=kitchen&sprefix=heißluftfritteuse+2+kammern+groß%2Ckitchen%2C115&sr=1-21). The primary reason for selecting this particular model was rather practical – it was given to me at no cost.

In the process of determining whether an air-fryer was a necessary addition to my kitchen, I started keeping a record of my cooking trials. This was initially for personal reference. However, after receiving queries from friends for recipes and advice, I've decided to share these notes more broadly.

This blog serves as a compilation of my experiences and experiments with the air-fryer. It's an understated journey through various recipes, ranging from the straightforward to the slightly more complex. If you're exploring the world of air-frying, you may find the information here to be of some use."
