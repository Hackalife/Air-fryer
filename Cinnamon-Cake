Zimtkuchen (Cinnamon Cake)

The Recipe:
- 60 ml Water
- 2 Eggs
- 180 ml Milk (I use oat milk)
- 150 g Flour (standard plain wheat flour)
- 120 g Sugar
- 1 Teaspoon Cinnamon
- 1 Tablespoon Baking Powder (approx. 5 g)
- 1 Tablespoon Cocoa"


The Batter for Two Small Baking Tins (For reference, see Air-fryer/Casserole)
Before starting with the batter, I turn the air fryer on to preheat it to 180째C.
Simply mix all the ingredients together, starting with the liquids.
I usually lay them all out on the table, and begin with:

1) Water
2) Milk
3) Eggs
4) Cocoa
5) Cinnamon
6) Baking Powder
7) Flour
8) Sugar

I mix it using the same spoon I use for measuring the cocoa and the baking powder,
keeping it simple. Usually, mixing for 2 minutes is sufficient.

Then, I fill the casserole to three-quarters full, as it will rise later.

I then gently place the baking tins in the heated chambers of the air fryer.
Giving it the first 15 minutes at 170째C. Every 5 minutes, 
checking visually to see how the dough is rising. After 15 minutes,
 it should have reached its ideal height.
 I continue to bake it for 9 more minutes at 100째C to ensure it's evenly baked.
Then, I increase the temperature of the air fryer to 200째C for 1 minute to achieve a crunchy crust on top.

I remove the casseroles with a pair of BBQ tongs and let them cool down to room temperature.

To remove the cake from the tin, I use a butter knife to cut around the rim, then firmly twist and shake the tin upside down. 
This usually works well, and no additional oil or butter is needed for preparation.
