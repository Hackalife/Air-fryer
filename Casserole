The Casserole

I was in search of a casserole dish suitable for baking small items in the air fryer. 
To my surprise, it functions quite well. 
Initially, my quest involved finding an appropriate baking tin, and I eventually settled on this one:
[Baking Tin on Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B00TV2HXTY?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details),
which has proved to be very effective.

Its dimensions are 15 x 6 x 6.5 cm, a volume of 585 cmÂ³.
I acquired two baking tins, allowing me to work with roughly 1 litre of batter.

A pair of BBQ tongs has been incredibly useful for safely removing the hot baking tin from the air fryer chamber.
